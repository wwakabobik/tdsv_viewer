![TDSV Viewer interface](https://github.com/wwakabobik/tdsv_viewer/blob/master/tdv_viewer.PNG)

Browser based on Mozilla/4.0 engine and compatible with IE 7.0. Browser contains some usual basic functionality of browsers that period of time, like navigation history, load/save websites or files, printing, autonomous work. App designed to be installed/uninstalled via install program. Also this browser contains unusual functions like encrypt/decrypt *.cod (Enigma) cyphered files. For Enigma please refer to my another repo - [cyphers](https://github.com/wwakabobik/cyphers). Also, it's only app which can handle and read *.dos files (Data Object Secure), which needed to make and play chains of *.cod files in browser.

App developed in Borland C++ Builder 5 in 2004. [Link to binaries](http://illusionist7.narod.ru/download/PROGS/TDSVV.rar).
